<p>A fork for this discontinued java decompiler.</p>

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>Java, reflexion, bytecode, come on! the source is there, that's pretty clever. </p>

<p>Despite of who think in this kind of programs like bad software (rippers, crackers or something like that) the fact is that nowadays there's a lot of sane applicattions for it.</p>

<p>Learning is the first, as much as any program you could use cannot be deployed without a plethora of projects how gracefully share this code, if you want to do so on and close source project I think it is your decision. You pay for your supply, your machine, your connection and many of the software you use (meaning you have for sure free software, I don't suggest you have cracked software, and I discouraged it) Why not take a look if you find that interesting. Must you reinvent the wheel? Wrong decision. Just change what is wrong and keep what is fine, I bet that you cannot get there easily just for taking a look to the code, but you can learn and become a better programmer. </p>

<p>Fixing is another application, believe this when I say that your time is not the other's time. You find a software, you find a bug, you find a new amazing feature, a more useful layout, and you share it with the owner of the program... Bad news, He doesn't mind, he doesn't have time, he think it is a silly thing or for me the worst possibility: He think it's great and will modify the program as soon as possible (You've got another thing comming). So why not modify it yourself?</p>

<p>Open source is the response, meanwhile decompilers are your friends</p>

<p>The original project seems freezed since 2009, although I think it is pretty well designed and just need some fixes.</p>
