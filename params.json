{"body":"## jclazz\r\n\r\nA fork for this discontinued java decompiler.\r\n\r\n### Intro\r\n\r\nJava, reflexion, bytecode, come on! the source is there, that's pretty clever. \r\n\r\nDespite of who think in this kind of programs like bad software (rippers, crackers or something like that) the fact is that nowadays there's a lot of sane applicattions for it.\r\n\r\nLearning is the first, as much as any program you could use cannot be deployed without a plethora of projects how gracefully share this code, if you want to do so on and close source project I think it is your decision. You pay for your supply, your machine, your connection and many of the software you use (meaning you have for sure free software, I don't suggest you have cracked software, and I discouraged it) Why not take a look if you find that interesting. Must you reinvent the wheel? Wrong decision. Just change what is wrong and keep what is fine, I bet that you cannot get there easily just for taking a look to the code, but you can learn and become a better programmer. \r\n\r\nFixing is another application, believe this when I say that your time is not the other's time. You find a software, you find a bug, you find a new amazing feature, a more useful layout, and you share it with the owner of the program... Bad news, He doesn't mind, he doesn't have time, he think it is a silly thing or for me the worst possibility: He think it's great and will modify the program as soon as possible (You've got another thing comming). So why not modify it yourself?\r\n\r\nOpen source is the response, meanwhile decompilers are your friends\r\n\r\nThe original project seems freezed since 2009, although I think it is pretty well designed and just need some fixes.\r\n\r\nYou can find the original project here [jclazz](http://jclazz.sourceforge.net/)\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
